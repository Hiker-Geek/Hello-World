This is a simple application using a combination of javascript, html, and css.
This application uses all three technologies because it is difficult to make a functioning, user friendly website by just using javascript or 
just using html--and css of course only works when paired with html. At least I personally find websites difficult to read when they do not
have any css, and I didn't want to just have an unprompted alert for javascript without explaining what it is and how to activate it.

As for why it is so decorated--I decided to have a little fun and make the site visually appealing. I figured doing so would also lend itself well
to making a user-friendly website with very clear instructions on how to operate it.

To start, unzip this file. Files cannot run if they are zipped. Then go to the unzipped file, and double click on the helloWorld.html file.
This will open the website in your browser.
